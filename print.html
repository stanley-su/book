<p>Cubing resources are easy to procure, but they often lack the proper annotations to explain the context -- When should I learn this? How much faster will I be? Is X the only way to Y? What sort of progression should I expect? Is this the best quality resource out there? As a result, cubers might get confused about what to learn next, or spent time learning stuff way too advanced for their level.</p>
<p>That's the motivation behind the Roux Reader. It hopes to fill this void for Roux method speedsolvers: by being the missing <strong>user manual</strong> that explains how to pick the top quality resources that are best suited to your skill level, and how to set expectations when learning them.</p>
<p>Content-wise, this reader is a tight coupling of two things: an improvement guide and a resource collection. The writers offer opinions to help you pick the right resources and answer all the common FAQs you might have, with the ultimate goal that you can walk away with a much better idea of where and how to improve your times next.</p>
<!--
Even when the right questions do get asked, they are answered times and again, leading to much inefficiency -- if only we can gather all these FAQs in one place and answer them once and for good!

<h2><a class="header" href="#how-to-read-the-reader" id="how-to-read-the-reader">How to Read the Reader?</a></h2>
<p>First off, this reader is written for Roux users of all levels, as long as you know beginner Roux. (If not, check out this awesome beginner tutorial <a href="https://tutorial.rouxers.com">guide</a> here).</p>
<p>There isn't a single recommended way of reading it, but here are some useful scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you already have a topic in mind (e.g. FB turning, EOLR progression), go find the related sections, and read the explanations to help you select the best resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are just randomly looking for things to learn, skim through the book for whatever interests you, and read up the section overview to discover exciting skills, techniques or concepts to work on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a particular question in mind, it might have been asked by many before. That's why we have created the <a href="book.rouxers.com/faqs.html">FAQ chapter</a>. Try your luck there!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#organization" id="organization">Organization</a></h2>
<p>At the top level, the reader is organized by the four steps in Roux -- FB, SB, CMLL &amp; LSE, plus a few chapters for generic topics that don't belong to a step. In Blockbuilding, we go over the three fundamental aspects of speedcubing -- <strong>solutions, fingertricks, and lookahead</strong>. For each of these subsections, we first provide an <strong>overview</strong> of what a fast cuber should be ideally doing, and talk about the <strong>progression</strong> -- what do I learn at different skill levels. This overview is followed by a curated list of <strong>resources</strong> with commentaries. In CMLL and LSE, this structure is generally followed, with the additional emphasis on sub-step variants and their algorithms. Lastly, while OH and 2H techniques can differ sometimes, they are usually discussed within the same subsections to avoid fragmentation.</p>

<p>This chapter talks about how to improve blockbuilding. We'll go over orientation, first block, second block, and alternative blockbuilding stragies.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first-block-vs-second-block-a-brief-overview" id="first-block-vs-second-block-a-brief-overview">First block vs. Second block: A brief overview</a></h2>
<p>Coming from the beginner's method, you might be employing similar techniques of loading the edge and pairing it with the corner for both FB and SB. However, going forward, you should realize FB and SB are fundamentally different steps that give rise to different sets of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FB planning is static</p>
<ul>
<li>You use inspection to thoroughly examine the cube and carefully craft an efficient solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SB solving is dynamic</p>
<ul>
<li>You track pieces in real time and make decisions on the fly, and you might sacrifice efficiency for better fluency and lookahead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#choosing-your-orientation" id="choosing-your-orientation">Choosing your Orientation</a></h2>
<p>Orientation describes what FB locations you would consider in inspection, i.e. what are the possible bottom and side colors for your FB. Orientation is usually denoted by one or two rotations: once you fix a particular FB you solve, all the other FBs you use can be reached by a combination of these rotations. For instance, x2y means all FBs that are {y, y', y2, x2, x2y, x2y', x2y2} away from the reference point.</p>
<p>Among the commonly seen orientations, x2y offers 8 FB options, while both y and x2y2 give 4. <strong>x2y is highly recommended.</strong> It is the minimal orientation that enables you to use ANY premade pairs. If you have to adopt y or x2y2 instead, the probability is reduced by half, so you'll get more difficult cases on average, but it's still somewhat acceptable. Anything below y or x2y2 would heavily limit your choices, and is recommended against.</p>
<!-- (on a side note: x2y2 means that you're more sensitive to the L/R sides as their colors are fixed.  ) -->
<p>Regarding CN: it gives you 24 options for FB, which is definitely a plus over x2y, but the benefits have not been proven as there has yet to be a world class full CN Rouxer. Some speculate the benefits would be minimal because there is limited time during inspection to analyse all 24 FB options. However, a counterpoint would be that for any first square, you have two choices of last pair to extend to a FB, making the last pair case much better on average. Therefore, once you find a good first square, you can usually settle on it and make better use of your inspection time by looking further into the solve. TL;DR: CN Roux is worthy of exploring, but don't force yourself.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the average movecount comparison of FB or FB + DR under different orientations, use the following resource:</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#step-i-basic-blockbuilding-strategies" id="step-i-basic-blockbuilding-strategies">Step I: Basic Blockbuilding Strategies</a></h3>
<p>Transitioning from the beginner method of edge loading spots, you should be aware of different blockbuilding strategies. There are broadly speaking two families of FB building strategy: <code>square + pair</code> and <code>line + line</code>, with the first one being more frequently used.</p>
<p>It is recommended to watch videos on blockbuilding strategies and have a basic understanding before you proceed to example solves.</p>
<p>Overall strategy:</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#relationship-to-planning" id="relationship-to-planning">Relationship to Planning</a></h3>
<p>Before we go on, note that <code>planning = solution + tracking</code>, with solution playing perhaps a more important role. For now stay stuned on getting you solutions right, and we'll cover tracking in the last section.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#step-ii-improve-your-solutions" id="step-ii-improve-your-solutions">Step II: Improve Your Solutions</a></h3>
<p>Next, you want to improve your solutions. There are several aspects you can work on, in no particular order. Not only are easier solutions faster to execute, but the ability to come up with them so will also help bring down your inspection time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Influencing</p>
<ul>
<li><code>square + pair</code> and <code>line + line</code> are both two-stage solutions, and the point is we want to find alternative ways to solve the first stage i.e. <code>square</code>/<code>E-line</code> so we get a better second stage case i.e. <code>pair</code>/<code>D-line</code>, respectively. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize your Last Pair solution</p>
<ul>
<li>FB last pair has lots of cases and elegant solutions can escape your notice. Drill on these in the following ways: use trainers to get random cases and reference the solutions; do untimed solves and experiment around with different ways to solve the same LP case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch Example Solves</p>
<ul>
<li>Trainers can only help you so far -- example FB solves remain the best way to learn new ideas. Either watch example solves or go over text reconstructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a Taste for good FB / FS</p>
<ul>
<li>Taste is about being able to tell an easy FB from a hard one quickly without fully planning it out. This would help you take advantage of all the FB options given by your orientation.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#turning" id="turning">Turning</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You want to have calm and fluid turning for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to give yourself time to track SB pieces, and turning too fast can result in losing track of pieces.</li>
<li>FB is a bad moveset group that generally involve both F and B moves. It is intrinsically more difficult to fingertrick. If you rush, you could overshoot or get your grips wrong, resulting in bad lockups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan out your fingertricks in inspection too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the rest of the solve, FB fingertricking requires your active attention. You should limit your regrips and eliminate pauses between moves. Try to figure all these out in inspection --- This can be just as important as planning out the actual solution! Over time, you'll grow familiar and be able to plan fingertricks automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, develop a preference for what pairs / triggers are easy for you to execute over time, and try to prioritize them in your FB solution. Use this to guide your FB planning instead of move count as this is more precise and correlated to actual times.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;line + line&quot; strategy refers to two lines: E-line (2 edges and 1 center on the E slice) and D-line (1 edge and 2 corners on the D slice). E-lines are usually formed first.</p>

<p>DR first is used by most of the world-level rouxers today including Kian Mansour and Sean Villanueva. Most of the existing SB resources are built on top of it. It is easy to make progress with, as it greatly simplifies tracking and pattern recognition for SB blockbuilding.</p>
<p>Freestyle, in contrast, allows you to be flexible with how you build the second square. It is a superset of DR first. Strategies include make a pair then insert the remaining edge, or insert any edge then insert the remaining pair.</p>
<p>The consensus is while freestyle potentially leads to better efficiency, it is more demanding of your recognition and tracking skills<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Empirically,   it has yet to be proven that freestyle can serve as a standalone strategy to attain a speed level comparable to those using DR-first.</p>
<p>In general, DR first is recommended to beginners and advanced cubers alike as the dominant strategy, while freestyle can act as a supplement, offering shortcuts to building SS whenever you happen to recognize a few easy freestyle patterns as they show up. These SS techniques will be mentioned in the section below.</p>

<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>: (Most SS strategies are such that once you solve the starting piece/pieces the SS becomes fixed meaning you're left with no options or freedom to select in what order to continue to block-build, whereas DR-first is the only exception among these strategies to NOT fix the SS but rather enables you to choose any of the two remaining pairs (SP). The very existence of two competing options alone would boost the chance of there being a good case, and additionally create room for influencing techniques. Therefore, in order to beat DR first on average, you would need more information about SS, e.g you saw DR is bad and another edge is good and the corresponding SS corner can be paired in such a way that gives an easy SS finish, etc. )</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#when-should-i-start-learning-full-cmlleolr" id="when-should-i-start-learning-full-cmlleolr">When should I start learning full CMLL/EOLR?</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended to learn full CMLL as soon as possible, as you are going to have to learn it eventually. However, as a general guideline, the latest you should begin to learn is when averaging around 20-30 seconds.</p>
<p>EOLR should only be learnt after learning full CMLL. Similarly to CMLL, learning it as soon as possible is recommended, but a recommended time to start learning is when averaging around 15 seconds.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-improve-my-blocks" id="how-do-i-improve-my-blocks">How do I improve my blocks?</a></h2>
<p>We recommend looking at solves from fast roux solvers (Kian, Sean, etc.), and understanding how they plan and optimise their blocks (movecounts, ergonomics). Example solves are preferred as the thought process is explained, but reconstructions are sufficient as well.</p>
<p>We also recommend using the following block trainers to practice identifying optimal solutions for blocks</p>
